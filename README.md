# Le_h_and_Johnathan_y_Music_mixer
We created the website for this project to resemble a dance club where people may dance and play music. It is a music-related website. Users can drag and drop icons to compose music based on their tastes, and we have simulated using animations to provide the best user experience possible.
## Installation
We searched many websites to have ideas for this project, from interest and other svgs websites. Then we organized what we want to put by drawing in our sketchbook to imagine how it looks. After that, we use Illustrator to make buttons, icons and make it looks like a real website but in 2D. Finally, we created folders and pushed them on GitHub.
## Usage
The icons will change when you hover them, you can drag and drop the icons so they can play music and our website has buttons to stop or play the music.  
## Contributing
1. We created my repo for this assignment
2. Then we created our feature branches: `des.jy.ha.musicmix` and `dev-folder`
3. We commited my changes: `everytime we change something in our files`
4. Each of us pushed to the branch: `push to my main branch`
5. After all, we submit a pull request <3
## History
At first, we discussed what we want it to look like, then we consulted the web to look for samples and sketch what we wanted to put in the website. Next, we used Illustrator to replicate the design as the same as in the sketch and change it to make sure it work out, then we coded it out and finally put it on Git Hub.
